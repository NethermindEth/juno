// Package jsonrpc is a JSON-RPC 2.0 library for Go. This implementation abstracts the low-level
// details of JSON-RPC 2.0 and provides a high-level programming interface. The idea is that this
// implementation is not oriented to the specific connection protocol (TCP, HTTP, etc.). It is
// intended to be used by other libraries that manage the connections.
package jsonrpc
