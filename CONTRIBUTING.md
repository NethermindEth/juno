- **Provide the steps to reproduce the bug**, so others can replicate it.
- **Include details about your environment**, such as operating system and software version.
- **Explain the expected behavior**, and contrast it with what actually happens.
- **Add screenshots or logs if necessary** to help explain the problem.

### Requesting Features

If you have an idea for a feature request, please use the issue tracker to propose your suggestions. Provide context and examples for your proposal to help others understand and evaluate it.

### Submitting Changes

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from 'main'.
2. **Commit your changes** with clear and descriptive messages.
3. **Push your branch** to your forked repository.
4. **Open a pull request** on the main repository.

### Coding Guidelines

### Code of Conduct

Have you read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?

## Bugs and Feature Requests

Before you make your changes, check to see if an [issue](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/issues) already exists for the change you want to make.

### Don't See Your Issue? Open One

If you spot something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Open a Pull Request

When you are done making changes and you would like to propose them for review, use the pull request template to open your PR (pull request).

If your PR is not ready for review and merge because you are still working on it, please convert it to a draft and add the label `wip` (work in progress). This label allows for the correct filtering of the rest of the PRs that are not `wip`.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Suggest your change by opening an issue and starting a discussion.

### Improving Issues and PRs

Please add, if possible, a reviewer, assignees, and labels to your issue and PR.

## DOs and DON'Ts

Please do:

* **DO** give priority to the current style of the project or file you're changing, even if it diverges from the general guidelines.
* **DO** include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start by adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
* **DO** especially follow our rules in the [Contributing](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#contributing) section of our code of conduct.

Please do not:

* **DON'T** fill the issues and PR descriptions vaguely. The elements in the templates are there for a good reason. Help the team.
* **DON'T** surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.

## Branch Naming

Branch names must follow the `kebab-case` pattern. Follow the pattern `feature/<name>` or `fix/<name>` (`folder/<name>`) when it is possible, and add an issue reference if applicable.
