# Blockifier-in-go

Blockifier-in-go is a very early-stage Golang implementation of the Rust blockfier crate that functions as the execution layer for Starknet. It connects the full client to the cairo-vm. This package sketches out some core components, including the `state`, `execution`, and `transaction` packages. In particular, it focuses on the definition of the `ExecutableTransaction` type and the execution path from `Execute` down to `run_execute_invoke` and `callEntryPoint.Execute()`. A very important goal of this package is to be as performant as the Rust version. This creates an interesting engineering challenge, given that Rust has zero-cost abstractions and no garbage collector etc, while typical Golang features like interfaces introduce a lot of inefficiencies (dynamic dispatch introduces lookup costs and prevents the compiler from making aggressive optimizations such as inlining).
