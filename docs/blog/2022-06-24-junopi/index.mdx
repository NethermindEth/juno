Juno is a node which aims to help **decentralise StarkNet, a prominent Ethereum Layer 2**.

For its mission to be achieved, it needs people to **start running their own node**.

To become one of the early few making StarkNet better, read below.

### Disclaimer

In this short article we lay out the steps to get a Raspberry PI with a working [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/)
installation to run the Juno StarkNet node. We assume that you have access as a root user to the Pi.

At time of writing, **both StarkNet and Juno are still in an early release**. Expect this guide and required steps to change often!

For the latest on the project, check out our [Github repo](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno), and refer to our
[Documentation](https://gojuno.xyz/).

The disk space issues are currently work in progress, and will be addressed in an upcoming new release.

## üéØ Features

- [Get and Sync state from Layer 1](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/sync) (Ethereum).
- [Get and Sync state from API](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/sync) (Feeder Gateway).
- Store [StarkNet State](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/sync) locally.
- Store StarkNet Transactions.
- Store StarkNet Blocks.
- Store the ABI and full code of StarkNet contracts.
- Ethereum-like [JSON RPC API](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/rpc) following
[this spec](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/blob/master/api/starknet_api_openrpc.json). Currently
supported are:
- `starknet_getBlockWithTxHashes` - Get block information with transaction hashes given the block id.
- `starknet_getBlockWithTxs` - Get block information with full transactions given the block id.
- `starknet_getStateUpdate` - Get the information about the result of executing the requested block.
- `starknet_getStorageAt` - Get the value of the storage at the given address and key.
- `starknet_getTransactionByHash` - Get the details and status of a submitted transaction.
- `starknet_getTransactionByBlockIdAndIndex` - Get the details of a transaction by a given block id and index.
- `starknet_getTransactionReceipt` - Get the transaction receipt by the transaction hash.
- `starknet_getClassHashAt` - Get the contract class hash in the given block for the contract deployed at the given address.
- `starknet_getBlockTransactionCount` -  Get the number of transactions in a block given a block id.
- `starknet_call` - Call a StarkNet function without creating a transaction.
- `starknet_blockNumber` - Get the most recent accepted block number.
- `starknet_blockHashAndNumber` - Get the most recent accepted block hash and number.
- `starknet_chainId` - Return the currently configured StarkNet chain id.
- `starknet_pendingTransactions` - Returns the transactions in the transaction pool, recognized by this sequencer.
- `starknet_syncing` - Returns an object about the sync status, or false if the node is not synching.
- [Prometheus Metrics](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/metrics).
- [Dockerized app](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/running/docker).

## Installation

### Specification ü§ñ

    - Raspberry 4 (model B) - 4GB running Raspbian
    - MicroSD card - 16GB+ (Class 10 Minimum) or SSD
    - Power supply
    - Internet connection (ethernet preferrable)
    - USB keyboard, a monitor, and an HDMI cable to interact with the computer or ssh into the raspberry pi.

### Get Golang ü¶´

Ensure that your Raspberry Pi is up-to-date.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

Check the [Golang download website](https://go.dev/dl/) for the latest armv6l version. At time of writing, we would download go 1.18.3.

```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.18.3.linux-armv6l.tar.gz -O go.tar.gz
```

Now extract the tarball into your /usr/local/ directory (root access required).

```bash
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go.tar.gz
```

Add the following to your shell config (usually ~/.bashrc).
If you have no preferred text editor, you can use `nano ~/.bashrc` to edit your bash config from the terminal.

```bash 
# ~/.bashrc
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

Afterwards press `CTRL` + `X` and then `Y` to exit the nano text editor and save the file.

Finally, as your `.bashrc` is only initialised when the shell is started, you need to source the new `~/.bashrc` to update available commands.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

You should now have a working Golang installation in your Raspberry Pi. You can check it typing:

```bash
go version
```

### Install Juno ‚öôÔ∏è

### Installing

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno
```

#### Install Python dependencies

We are currently only support python `3.7`, and we recommend use pyenv. To install it, you can follow this instruction:

1. Install dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make build-essential git patch zlib1g-dev clang \
  openssl libssl-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev llvm \
  libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev \
  liblzma-dev
```

2. Install pyenv:

```shell
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

3. Add the following entries into your `~/.bashrc` file:

```shell
# pyenv
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

4. Restart your shell:

```shell
exec $SHELL
```

5. Install Python 3.7:

```shell
pyenv install 3.7.13
pyenv global 3.7.13
```

6. Inside of the project folder, install Python dependencies:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirenments.txt
```

#### Installing Go dependencies

You can install all golang dependencies running the next command inside the project folder:

```bash
$ go get ./...
```

### Compile

```bash
$ make juno
```

### Run

To synchronize with the StarkNet state from the centralized feeder gateway, run the following
command:

```bash
# For Ethereum Goerli testnet
$ ./build/juno

# For Ethereum Mainnet
$ ./build/juno --netowrk 1
```

To sync the state without relying on the feeder gateway, configure an Ethereum node and run the following command:

```bash
# For Ethereum Goerli testnet
$ ./build/juno --eth-node "<node-endpoint>"

# For Ethereum Mainnet
$ ./build/juno --netowrk 1 --eth-node "<node-endpoint>"
```

To view other available options please run `./build/juno -h`.

For more configuration details, check the [config description](/docs/running/config).

## Configuring Juno

When syncing the StarkNet state from a Raspberry Pi, we expect you to have at least 64GB. In case of you don't have
this space, you can run it using an SSD, ensuring that the property `db-path` in the config or the flag `--db-path`
points to the external SSD:

```yaml
# juno.yaml
db-path: /path/to/ssd/database/here
```

And yes, you are now helping on the StarkNet decentralisation!
