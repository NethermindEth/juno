For the formatting we are using [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt), which is basically a repository on top of gofmt

If you want to install `gofumpt`, you can run the next command:

```bash
make install-gofumpt
```

If you want to format your code  you can use:

```bash
make format
```

For most of the common editors like [vim](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt#vim-go),
[golang](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt#goland), or
[vscode](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt#visual-studio-code), there is a way to set your editor to format by default
