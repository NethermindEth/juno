# Building

```
docker build . -t juno
```

# Creating a volume for Data

You can create your volume and bind it directly, in any other case, you can just use one volume created by docker. For
example:

```
docker volume create juno_data
```

# Running

Create your config file and update to desired values, see [Configuration](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno#configuration)
in the Readme of the project.

You can run your app using docker if you follow previous process:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v juno_data:/home/app/.config/juno/data -v /path/to/your/config/file/juno.yaml:/home/app/.config/juno/juno.yaml juno
```

You need to be aware that the value of `db_path` inside config is the same that the one set to link the value of the
`juno_data` volume.

Remember to export the ports you are using.
