title: Layer 1 Integration
---

For layer 1 integration is expected to get the State Root of one Connection to one Archive Node, store that information
and be aware of reorganizations in the chain. We should only fetch the state root since Starknet contract was deployed.

This will be as simple as call a function once implemented the [Feeder Gateway Client](./feeder-gateway.mdx), and call
the `get_contract_addresses` method.

Work done until now:
1. Continuously fetches ethereum state-root by maintaining a websocket connection with a Layer 1 node

Need To be done:
2. Create a better flow in the implementation, like move for loop outside implemented function and pass Connection to
the Layer 1 node, so function is client-agnostic
3. Store each state-root that is fetched from the L1 node - (decide on format to store in etc.)
4. Handling reorganizations:
    - how does the system notice
    - Get the depth of the reorganization.
    - Reorganizations notification system.
    - replacing reorganized state roots in database.
    - see [state reorganizations](./state-reorganizations.mdx) for more details about how this should be done.

5. Consider continuous polling vs maintaining a websocket connection(Probably websockets is the best connection for this
stage taking a look at [this](https://ably.com/blog/websockets-vs-long-polling#:~:text=WebSockets%20keeps%20a%20unique%20connection,more%20information%20from%20the%20server.))


# Storing Ethereum State

[Here](https://medium.com/hackernoon/getting-deep-into-ethereum-how-data-is-stored-in-ethereum-e3f669d96033#:~:text=A%20storage%20trie%20is%20where,(which%20we%20just%20discussed).) we
can see some explication to how Ethereum State is stored.
