In the current stage of the Alpha, StarkNet operates in a ZK-Rollup mode. This means that upon the acceptance of a state
update on-chain, the state diff between the previous and new state is sent as calldata to Ethereum.

This data allows anyone that observes Ethereum to reconstruct the current state of StarkNet. Note that to update the
StarkNet state on L1, it suffices to send a valid proof – without information on the transactions or particular changes
that this update caused. Consequently, more information must be provided in order to allow other parties to locally
track StarkNet’s state.

Our plan is to fetch that data and reconstruct the StarkNet state.
