title: Starknet State Integration
---

In order to archive the full Starknet State integration, we need to first implement a
[Feeder Gateway Client](./feeder-gateway.mdx), after that, we should be able to get the state from the Gateway iterating
over all the blocks, from block 0 to the latest.


First we need to build the Starknet State, as described [here](https://starknet.io/documentation/starknet-state/).

After that, we will need to iterate over all the previous state updates, and update our state, making a sequence of calls
to get_state_update using the feeder gateway. We should receive a set of requests like this:
```json
{
  "block_hash" : "hash",
  "old_root" : "hash",
  "new_root" : "hash",
  "state_diff" : {
    "deployed_contracts" : [
      "addresses"
    ],
    "storage_diffs" : [
      {
        "hash" : [
          {
            "key" : "hash",
            "value" : "hash"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }

}
```

An example request can be found calling [this](https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/get_state_update?block_number=1).

Using this info, we should iterate over the Starknet State and update it.

We need to be aware of how reorgs works between Layer 1 State and Starknet State, for further details about
this topic, refer to [State Reorganizations](./state-reorganizations.mdx).
