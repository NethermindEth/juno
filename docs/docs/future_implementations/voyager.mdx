title: Feeder Gateway Middleware
description: Api exposed from the node.
---

We have plans for expose an API that act as a middleware between any app that connects to the Feeder Gateway. With this
feature, any app should be able to connect directly to the node and fetch the info that we have stored locally or in
the worst case scenario, call the feeder gateway.

To make this possible, we implemented the [Feeder Gateway Client](../features/feeder-gateway.mdx).
