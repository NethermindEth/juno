title: Voyager Integration
---

With the [Voyager](https://github.com/DemerzelSolutions/voyager) integration, we expect to work for now as a middleware
between Voyager and the Starknet Gateway, and make Voyager start to rely on Juno.

To make this possible, we should implement the [Feeder Gateway Client](./feeder-gateway.mdx).

They only use the next endpoints to connect to the Gateway:
- get_full_contract
- get_block

Once the Feeder Gateway is ready, we should implement a server for these endpoints and just call the methods directly
connecting now to the gateway.

Later, when we were ready, we should be able to handle these responses by our own, connection to Starknet State.
