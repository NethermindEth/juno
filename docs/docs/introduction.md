# Welcome to Juno :wave:

Juno is a Starknet full-node client developed by Nethermind to allow node operators to easily and reliably contribute to the Starknet network and advance its decentralisation goals. Juno works for casual node setups, production-grade indexers, and everything in between.

- :cd: **Compact database footprint**: Approximately 156GB on mainnet.
- :zap: **Ultra-fast synchronisation**: Limited only by your hardware and the sequencer.
- :100: **Complete [JSON-RPC spec](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/tree/master) compliance**: Everything Starknet, accessible from a single point.
- :racing_car: **Minimal RPC response latency**: Ensuring your applications run smoothly.
- :mag_right: **Low-level gRPC database API**: Tailored for the most intensive workloads.
- :globe_with_meridians: **Websocket interface**: For seamless real-time updates.

## Getting started

Explore the basics of setting up and managing your Juno node with the following resources:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: "link",
      href: "running-juno",
      label: "Running a Juno node",
    },
    {
      type: "link",
      href: "configuring",
      label: "Juno configuration options",
    },
    {
