# Running a Juno P2P Node

Juno can be run as a peer-to-peer node for decentralised data synchronisation and to enhance the resilience and reliability of the Starknet network. Check out theÂ [Juno peer-to-peer launch](https://medium.com/nethermind-eth/junos-experimental-peer-to-peer-launch-3040e195550d) guide to learn how it works.

:::caution
The P2P feature is currently under active development and is being tested on smaller Juno networks. As a result, syncing with non-Juno nodes may be unstable.
