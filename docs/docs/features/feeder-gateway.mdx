title: Feeder Gateway Connection
---

Starknet Api Getaway:
- integration: https://external.integration.starknet.io
- Goerli: http://alpha4.starknet.io
- MainNet: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io

For the feeder Gateway, we will need to create a client, we should base on
[this](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/services/api/feeder_gateway/feeder_gateway_client.py)
maybe and the methods implemented there.

Once we have a Gateway Client, we should be able to get to connect to these endpoints:
- get_contract_addresses
- call_contract
- get_block
- get_state_update
- get_code
- get_full_contract
- get_storage_at
- get_transaction_status
- get_transaction
- get_transaction_receipt
- get_block_hash_by_id
- get_block_id_by_hash
- get_transaction_hash_by_id
- get_transaction_id_by_hash

This should be implemented gradually, in the beginning, for the interaction with the
Layer 1 and Starknet State, we will only need:
- get_contract_addresses

We will need this endpoint to get the Starknet contract hash, and, with that information, we can know since which block
start to get the state in Layer 1.

For this connection, you will need to add to the configuration, a params, `starknet_network`, that should be allocated
at some point around [here](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/blob/main/internal/config/config.go#L23) and in case
of property don't exist, throw an error, just like starknet cli app.

Fixed in this [PR](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/pull/101)
